					<td>Deliberate and malicious exploitation of bugs to gain an advantage over other players are strictly forbidden. Some examples follow:
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Server exploits</li>
							<li>Intentionally causing the game to crash</li>
							<li>Gold and item manipulation</li>
						</ul>
						If you encounter any bug, it must be reported using the <span class="label label-info" data-action="popover" data-placement="right" data-original-title="How does the report function work?" data-content="Use 'ctrl+z' ingame and a bug report window will appear, enter your report under the appropiate category and a staff member will deal with it.">report function</span> immediately.

					<td><b>Gameplay</b></td>
					<td><b>Third-party software that performs actions for you (also known as Bots)</b>
						<br>
						Performing actions such as killing monsters or casting spells while being idle from the game is never tolerated.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Keep in mind that using third-party software to control at least one character while you are logged into other characters will always mean that you are idle on at least one of them, as you can not actively play on several characters at the same time. In such situations, all of the characters you are logged into are violating the rules.</b>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="label label-info" data-action="popover" data-placement="right">Interesting note:</span> It is not illegal to use a bot to assist your gameplay as long as you aren't idle from the game and it doesn't violate any other rule.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Using third-party software to run gambling or "trust" games</b>
						<br>
						You are not allowed to use third-party software in order to run gambling or "trust" games at the depot, we are enforcing this rule to prevent possibly modified "casino bots" taking up all the depot slots.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="label label-info" data-action="popover" data-placement="right">Interesting note:</span> You are allowed to run a casino in other areas, for example in a house. You should also avoid so called "trust" games, they are usually demonstrated between friends to look real, but once you trust the player with valuable items they will be stolen from you.

					<td><b>Public Chat Channels and Advertising</b></td>
					<td>Inappropiate usage of public chat channels is prohibited and may result in a punishment.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Advertising:</b>
					<br>
					The advertising chat may be used for three things:
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Advertising a trade of ingame items</li>
						<li>Advertising that you are selling or buying a house for ingame gold/items</li>
						<li>Advertising quest services</li>
					</ul>
					<b>Help Channel</b>
					<br>
					You are only allowed to use the help channel in order to ask/answer questions about Burmourne and its gameplay. Inappropiate usage of the help channel may result in a temporary mute.
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>World Chat</b>
					<br>
					This is where you are free to chat about almost anything.
					<br>
					<br>
					What is not allowed in World Chat?
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Insulting, harassing or racist statements:</b><br>
						If you have personal problems with another player, deal with it in private. Harassing a player in World Chat will only put you in trouble, even if the other player has offended you in private. If you are lucky, you might get away with a warning; if that isn't enough to make you stop it will lead to a banishment. </li>
						<li><b>Sexually related statements:</b><br>
						Keep in mind that there are children that play Burmourne too, sexually related statements may not be suitable for them and will therefore not be tolerated in public chat channels. </li>
					</ul>
					<b>English Chat:</b>
					<br>
					The same rules as the World Chat apply to the English Chat, with one additional rule: English only.
